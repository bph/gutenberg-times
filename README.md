This repository was bootstrapped based on tutorials from Gutenberg Handbook:
- [Getting Started with JavaScript](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/designers-developers/developers/tutorials/javascript/)
- [JavaScript Build Setup](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/designers-developers/developers/tutorials/javascript/js-build-setup/).

## Usage

With a setup in place, the standard workflow is:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start development builds: `npm start`
- Develop. Test. Repeat.
- Create production build: `npm run build`
